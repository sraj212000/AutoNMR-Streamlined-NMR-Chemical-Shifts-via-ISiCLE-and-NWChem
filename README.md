# AutoNMR-Streamlined-NMR-Chemical-Shifts-via-ISiCLE-and-NWChem
This repository aims to design and implement an automated workflow to streamline NMR chemical shift calculations using [NWChem](https://www.nwchem-sw.org/). It also involves developing a user-friendly Python API to define molecular systems and specify NMR parameters, simplifying the process and making it more efficient for researchers.
### The primary objectives of this repository are as follows:
- Design and implementation of an automated workflow that streamlines the process of NMR chemical shift calculations using NWChem
- Development of a user-friendly Python API (Application Programming Interface) for molecular system definition and NMR parameter specification
