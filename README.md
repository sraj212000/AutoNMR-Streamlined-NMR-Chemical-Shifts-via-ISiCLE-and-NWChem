# AutoNMR-Streamlined-NMR-Chemical-Shifts-via-ISiCLE-and-NWChem
This repository aims to design and implement an automated workflow to streamline NMR chemical shift calculations using NWChem. It also involves developing a user-friendly Python API to define molecular systems and specify NMR parameters, simplifying the process and making it more efficient for researchers.
