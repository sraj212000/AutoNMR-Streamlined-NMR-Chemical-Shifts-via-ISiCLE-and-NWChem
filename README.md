# AutoNMR-Streamlined-NMR-Chemical-Shifts-via-ISiCLE-and-NWChem
This repository aims to design and implement an automated workflow to streamline NMR chemical shift calculations using [NWChem](https://www.nwchem-sw.org/). It also involves developing a user-friendly Python API to define molecular systems and specify NMR parameters, simplifying the process and making it more efficient for researchers.

### The primary objectives of this repository are as follows:
- Design and implementation of an automated workflow that streamlines the process of NMR chemical shift calculations using NWChem
- Development of a user-friendly [Python](https://www.python.org/) API (Application Programming Interface) for molecular system definition and NMR parameter specification

### What Is NMR Chemical Shift ?
In NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy, chemical shifts denote the variations in the resonant frequency of a nucleus within a magnetic field, induced by its surrounding chemical environment. These variations arise from the shielding or deshielding effects exerted by the electron cloud around the nucleus. Local electron density variations, influenced by adjacent atoms or functional groups, modify the resonant frequency of the nucleus relative to a reference standard, typically tetramethylsilane (TMS) in organic solvents. This modification, quantified in parts per million (ppm), is termed the chemical shift. TMS, or (CH₃)₄Si, serves as the standard reference for chemical shifts, with δTMS defined as 0 ppm. Chemical shift measurements for ¹H nuclei in samples are referenced against the ¹H resonance of TMS. Grasping the trends in chemical shifts is essential for accurate NMR spectral interpretation.
